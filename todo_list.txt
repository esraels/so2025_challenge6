# TODO list:
- write in cpp:
    [ok]- initial implementation version:
    - write optimal version:
        - speed
            [ok]- implement different version with incremental optimization improvements.
            - provide input data.
                [ok]- random-pure
                [ok]- sorted
                - multiple answer
                - multiple answer within controlled range of index.
            - write all input data to file.
            - write output to different files.
            [ok]- read input data from file.
                [ok]- add commandline option to set how many loop to execute a single list of data.
            - read input data from external stream.
            [ok]- test data to both random and sorted data.
                [ok]- fix bug: -n not working.
                [ok]- test the input data files provided in the challenge site.
        - memory space.
    - write generic version:
        - supports negative numbers.
        - beyond 0-999 which is INT_MIN <= x <= INT_MAX.
    - accepts input from file.
    - accepts input from stdin stream.
    - benchmark performance:
        [ok]- speed
        - memory

- write in other language:
    - bash
    - python
    - batch
    - ruby
    - rust
    - jscript
