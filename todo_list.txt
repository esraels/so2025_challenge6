# TODO list:
- write in cpp:
    - initial implementation version:
    - write optimal version:
        - speed
        - memory
    - write generic version:
        - supports negative numbers.
        - beyond 0-999 which is INT_MIN <= x <= INT_MAX.
    - accepts input from file.
    - accepts input from stdin stream.
    - benchmark performance:
        - speed
        - memory

- write in other language:
    - bash
    - python
    - batch
    - ruby
